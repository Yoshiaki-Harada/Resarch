abstract = {Germany has one of the most competitive manufacturing industries in the world and is a global leader in the manufacturing equipment sector. This is in no small measure due to Germany's specialisation in research, development and production of innovative manufacturing technologies and the management of complex industrial processes. Germany's strong machinery and plant manufacturing industry, its globally significant level of IT competences and its know-how in embedded systems and automation engineering mean that it is extremely well placed to develop its position as a leader in the manufacturing engineering industry. Germany is thus uniquely positioned to tap into the potential of a new type of industrialisation: Industrie 4.0.},

The deeper meshing of the digital world with the world of machines holds the potential to bring about profound transformation to global industry, and in turn to many aspects of daily life, including the way many of us do our jobs. These innovations promise to bring greater speed and efficiency to industries as diverse as aviation, rail transportation, power generation, oil and gas development, and health care delivery.

abstract = "Cloud-based design manufacturing (CBDM) refers to a service-oriented networked product development model in which service consumers are enabled to configure, select, and utilize customized product realization resources and services ranging from computer-aided engineering software to reconfigurable manufacturing systems. An ongoing debate on CBDM in the research community revolves around several aspects such as definitions, key characteristics, computing architectures, communication and collaboration processes, crowdsourcing processes, information and communication infrastructure, programming models, data storage, and new business models pertaining to CBDM. One question, in particular, has often been raised: is cloud-based design and manufacturing actually a new paradigm, or is it just “old wine in new bottles”? To answer this question, we discuss and compare the existing definitions for CBDM, identify the essential characteristics of CBDM, define a systematic requirements checklist that an idealized CBDM system should satisfy, and compare CBDM to other relevant but more traditional collaborative design and distributed manufacturing systems such as web- and agent-based design and manufacturing systems. To justify the conclusion that CBDM can be considered as a new paradigm that is anticipated to drive digital manufacturing and design innovation, we present the development of a smart delivery drone as an idealized CBDM example scenario and propose a corresponding CBDM system architecture that incorporates CBDM-based design processes, integrated manufacturing services, information and supply chain management in a holistic sense."

@article{Ghomi2019,
abstract = {Cloud manufacturing (CMfg) is a new manufacturing paradigm over computer networks aiming at using distributed resources in the form of manufacturing capabilities, hardware, and software. Some modern technologies such as cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), service-oriented, and radio-frequency identification (RFID) play a key role in CMfg. In CMfg, all resources needed for manufacturing such as hardware, software, and manufacturing capabilities are virtualized; the services are provided by manufacturing resources. In this paper, the key characteristics, concepts, challenges, open issues, and future trends of cloud manufacturing are presented to direct the future researches. Accordingly, five directions of advances in CMfg are introduced and the articles in five categories are reviewed and analyzed: (1) studies focused on the architecture and platform design of CMfg; (2) studies concentrated on resource description and encapsulation; (3) studies focused on service selection and composition; (4) studies aimed at resource allocation and service scheduling; and (5) studies aimed at service searching and matching. The article also aims at providing a development diagram in the area of CMfg as a roadmap for future research opportunities and practice.},

abstract = "The focus of this paper is on matching service seekers and service providers, such as designers and machine owners, in cloud-based design and manufacturing (CBDM). In such decentralized scenarios the objectives and preferences of service seekers are different from those of service providers. Current resource configuration methods are unsuitable because they optimize the objectives of only one type of participants – either service seekers or service providers. Existing marketplaces based on first-come-first-serve (FCFS) approach are inefficient because they may not result in optimal matches. To address these limitations there is a need for mechanisms that result in optimal matching considering the private preferences of all the agents. In this paper, we formulate the resource allocation problem as a bipartite matching problem. Four bipartite matching mechanisms, namely, Deferred Acceptance (DA), Top Trading Cycle (TTC), Munkres, and FCFS are analyzed with respect to desired properties of the mechanisms such as individual rationality, stability, strategy proofness, consistency, monotonicity and Pareto efficiency. Further, the performance of these mechanisms is evaluated under different levels of resource availability through simulation studies. The appropriateness of matching mechanisms for different scenarios in CBDM such as fully decentralized, partially decentralized and totally monopolistic are assessed. Based on the analysis, we conclude that DA is the best mechanism for totally decentralized scenario, TTC is most appropriate when cloud-based resources are used in an organizational scenario, and Munkres is the best mechanism when all resources are owned by a single agent."

@article{Samimi2016,
abstract = {Users and providers have different requirements and objectives in an investment market. Users will pay the lowest price possible with certain guaranteed levels of service at a minimum and providers would follow the strategy of achieving the highest return on their investment. Designing an optimal market-based resource allocation that considers the benefits for both the users and providers is a fundamental criterion of resource management in distributed systems, especially in cloud computing services. Most of the current market-based resource allocation models are biased in favor of the provider over the buyer in an unregulated trading environment. In this study, the problem was addressed by proposing a new market model called the Combinatorial Double Auction Resource Allocation (CDARA), which is applicable in cloud computing environments. The CDARA was prototyped and simulated using CloudSim, a Java-based simulator for simulating cloud computing environments, to evaluate its efficiency from an economic perspective. The results proved that the combinatorial double auction-based resource allocation model is an appropriate market-based model for cloud computing because it allows double-sided competition and bidding on an unrestricted number of items, which causes it to be economically efficient. Furthermore, the proposed model is incentive-compatible, which motivates the participants to reveal their true valuation during bidding.},

@article{Chu2009,
abstract = {We address the mechanism design problem for a market with multiple buyers and sellers. Each buyer demands some bundle(s) of various commodities, and each seller supplies multiple units of one commodity. To design truthful double-auction mechanisms, we propose a novel "padding" method that intentionally creates imbalances between the supply availability and demand requirement by introducing a phantom buyer with unlimited budget. To the best of our knowledge, this "padding" method leads to a class of mechanisms that are the first strategy-proof, individually rational, budget-balanced, and asymptotically efficient mechanisms for the specified exchange environment. Furthermore, these mechanisms dominate known truthful bundle/single-unit mechanisms with higher efficiency, lower buying prices, and higher selling prices.},
